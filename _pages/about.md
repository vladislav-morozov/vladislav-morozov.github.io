## About

I hold a PhD in econometrics from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). Starting Fall, I will be joining the Institute of Finance and Statistics at the Department of Economics at the University of Bonn as an Assistant Professor.


## Research


**Research interests**: econometrics: econometrics of heterogeneity, panel data econometrics

I am interested in developing and analyzing practical econometric methods  with a focus on unobserved heterogeneity.
Unobserved heterogeneity is pervasive in economics, and there is ample empirical evidence of heterogeneity in coefficients, marginal effects, and other parameters of interest in applied work. Accordingly,	 I focus on identifying and estimating distributional features  of such heterogeneous  objects in all my projects.
