**Welcome to my personal website!**

I am a PhD candidate in econometrics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and Barcelona School of Economics (BSE) in Barcelona, Spain.

I am on the Job Market during the 2023-2024 academic year.


I am interested in developing and analyzing practical econometric methods  with a focus on unobserved heterogeneity.
Unobserved heterogeneity is pervasive in economics, and there is ample empirical evidence of heterogeneity in coefficients, marginal effects, and other parameters of interest in applied work. Accordingly,	 I focus on identifying and estimating distributional features  of such heterogeneous  objects in all my projects.



I am supervised by Prof. Christian Brownlees and Prof. Kirill Evdokimov.
