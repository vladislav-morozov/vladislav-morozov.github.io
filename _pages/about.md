## About

I am a PhD candidate in econometrics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and Barcelona School of Economics (BSE) in Barcelona, Spain.
My advisors are Prof. Christian Brownlees and Prof. Kirill Evdokimov.

I will be available on the Job Market during the 2023-2024 academic year.

## Research


**Research interests**: econometrics: econometrics of heterogeneity, panel data econometrics

I am interested in developing and analyzing practical econometric methods  with a focus on unobserved heterogeneity.
Unobserved heterogeneity is pervasive in economics, and there is ample empirical evidence of heterogeneity in coefficients, marginal effects, and other parameters of interest in applied work. Accordingly,	 I focus on identifying and estimating distributional features  of such heterogeneous  objects in all my projects.
