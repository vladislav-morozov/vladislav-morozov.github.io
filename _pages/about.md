**Welcome to my personal website!**

I am a PhD candidate in econometrics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Barcelona School of Economics in Barcelona, Spain.

My research interests are panel data econometrics and econometrics of pervasive heterogeneity. I am supervised by Prof. Christian Brownlees and Prof. Kirill Evdokimov.
