*Abstract*: In this work we introduce a unit averaging procedure to efficiently recover unit
specific parameters in a heterogeneous panel. The procedure consists in estimating
the parameter of a given unit using a weighted average of all the unit-specific
parameter estimators in the panel. The weights of the average are determined by
minimizing an MSE criterion that we derive. We analyze the properties of the
minimum MSE unit averaging estimator in a local heterogeneity framework inspired
by the literature on frequentist model averaging. The analysis of the estimator covers
both the cases in which the cross-sectional dimension of the panel is fixed and large.
In both cases, we obtain the local asymptotic distribution of the minimum MSE unit
averaging estimators and of the associated weights. A GDP nowcasting application
for a panel of European countries showcases the benefits of the procedure.
