*Abstract*:  We develop a methodology for conducting inference on extreme quantiles of unobserved
individual heterogeneity (heterogeneous coefficients, heterogeneous treatment
effects, and other unobserved heterogeneity) in a panel data or meta-analysis setting.
Examples of interest include productivity of most and least productive firms or prediction
intervals for study-specific treatment effects in meta-analysis. Inference in
such a setting is challenging. Only noisy estimates of unobserved heterogeneity are
available, and approximations based on the central limit theorem work poorly for
extreme quantiles. For this situation, under minimal assumptions we derive an extreme
value theorem for noisy estimates and appropriate rate and moment conditions. In
addition, we develop a theory for intermediate order statistics. Both extreme and
intermediate order theorems are then used to construct confidence intervals for extremal
quantiles. The limiting distribution is non-pivotal, and we show consistency of both
subsampling and simulating from the limit distribution. Furthermore, we provide a
novel self-normalized intermediate order theorem. In a Monte Carlo exercise, we show
that the resulting extremal confidence intervals have favorable coverage properties in
the tail.
