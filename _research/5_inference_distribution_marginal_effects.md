*Abstract*: This paper considers estimation of   the distribution of heterogeneous marginal effects using panel data.  We identify the distribution of interest by applying Kotlarski's lemma to a scaled difference of outcomes across periods.  Our results allow for location-scale effects that may depend on covariates, which are identified from straightforward moment conditions. We propose a suitable conditional deconvolution estimator for the distribution of marginal effects and establish its convergence range. The convergence rates depend on whether the distribution of time-varying unobservables is ordinary smooth or supersmooth.  We  also construct uniform confidence bands for the distribution of interest. To do so, we extending the recent results on robust inference in deconvolution problems to conditional deconvolution.
