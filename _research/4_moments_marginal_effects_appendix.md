*Description*: this Supplementary Appendix provides additional theoretical, numerical, and empirical results. First, we propose an alternative estimator for the moments of heterogeneous marginal effects. This estimator is based on estimating the moments of the finite differences of the structural functions, in line with the identification argument in the main text. We show that these estimators are asymptotically normal and derive their convergence rates. Second, we conduct a Monte Carlo study that replicates several key features of the empirical study.  In particular, we replicate the distribution of the observed variables and the estimated distributional features of the marginal effects.  The estimators perform well in this study, supporting the validity of the findings in the empirical result. Last, we provide some additional details related to our empirical application to Engel curves for food at home.
